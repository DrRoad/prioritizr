\usage{
relative_targets(x)

absolute_targets(x)

loglinear_targets(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{numeric} vector.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{Constraint}} object containing the target data.
}
\description{
After constructing a basic conservation \code{\link{problem}} that specifies
the cost and feature data, it needs to have targets added to it. Targets 
are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's distribution
that needs to be protected. Thus targets ensure that each species is 
adequately represented in the reserve network.
}
\details{
Targets can be specified using one of the functions below.
  \describe{
    \item{relative_targets}{Targets are expressed as a proportion (between 0
      and 1) of the maximum level of representation in the study area.
      The argument to \code{x} should have a single value if all features
      have the same target. Otherwise, the vector should have a value for
      each feature. In this case, targets are assigned to features based
      on the their position in the argument to \code{x} and the
      \code{feature} when specifying the problem.}
    \item{absolute_targets}{Targets are expressed as the actual value that
      needs to be represented in the prioritisation. The argument to 
      \code{x} is treated the same as for \code{relative_targets}.}
    \item{loglinear_targets}{Targets are expressed as a proportion (between 0
      and 1) which is calculated using a log-linear equation and four
      tuning parameters (as used in XXX \emph{et al.} XXX). The first
      tuning parameter specifies the first cut-off range size,
      and the second the second cut-off range size, the third argument
      specifies the target required for species with a range size equal
      to or less than the first cut-off range size, and the fourth
      argument specifies the target required for species with a range
      size equal to or greater than the required range size.}

# create basic problem
p <- problem(cost=sim_pu_raster, features=sim_features) + 
  minimium_set_objective()

# add relative targets
p + relative_targets(0.1)

# add absolute targets
p + absolute_targets(0.1)

# add log-linear target
p + loglinear_targets(c(1, 10, 0.9, 0.2))
