\description{
\pkg{prioritizr} is an \emph{R} package for solving systematic conservation
planning problems. By using integer linear programming (ILP)
techniques, this package offers a flexible interface for creating
reserve selection problems that can be tailored to the specific needs of the
conservation planner (Rodrigues \emph{et al.} 2000; Billionnet 2013).
Once built, problems can then be solved using a variety of commercial and
open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms
conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as greedy
heuristics or simulated annealing, the exact algorithms used by
\pkg{prioritizr} are guaranteed to find optimal solutions. This package
also has the functionality to read \href{http://marxan.net/}{\emph{Marxan}}
input data (Ball \emph{et al.} 2009) and find much better solutions in a much
shorter period of time than \emph{Marxan} (Beyer \emph{et al.} 2016).
Finally, conservation planning problems can be constructed to involve
allocating planning units to specific management zones (commonly referred
to as "zones functionality"). See the
\href{https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr}{online code repository}
for more information.
