\title{Add locked in constraints}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.}

\item{locked_in}{Object that determines which planning units that should be 
locked in. See details for more information.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.
}
\description{
Add constraints constraints to lock in planning units
so that they are selected in the solution. For example, it may
be desirable to lock in planning units already within existing
protected areas so that the solutions fills in the gaps in the existing
reserve network.
}
\details{
The locked in planning units can be specified in several 
  different ways:

  \describe{
  
  \item{\code{integer} \code{vector}}{indices for which planning units should
    be locked in.}

  \item{\code{character}}{column name in the attribute table with 
    \code{logical} values indicating if planning units should be locked in. 
    Note that \code{locked_in} can only a \code{character} if the planning
    units in \code{x} are a \code{\link{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame-class}}, 
    \code{\link{SpatialLinesDataFrame-class}}, or 
    \code{\link{SpatialPointsDataFrame-class}} object.}

  \item{\code{\link[raster]{Raster-class}} object}{Planning units in \code{x} 
    that intersect with cells in \code{y} that are not equal to zero and 
    not \code{NA} are locked in.}

  \item{\code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} object.}{planning units in \code{x} 
    that spatially intersect with \code{locked_in} are locked in.}

 }
