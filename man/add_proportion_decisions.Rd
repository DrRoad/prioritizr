\usage{
add_proportion_decisions(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\value{
\code{\link{Decision-class}} object.
}
\description{
Add a proportion decision to a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}}. 
This is a relaxed decision where a part of a planning unit can be prioritized, 
as opposed to the entire planning unit, which is the default function (see \code{\link{add_binary_decisions}}). 
Typically, this this decision has the assumed action of buying a fraction 
of a planning unit to include in a protected area network.
}
\details{
Conservation planning problems involve making decisions on planning units.
These decisions are then associated with actions (eg. turning a planning
unit into a protected area). If no decision is explicitly added to a problem, 
then the binary decision class will be used by default.Only a single decision 
should be added to a
\code{ConservationProblem} object. \strong{If multiple decisions are added
to a problem object, then the last one to be added will be used.}

\examples{
# create basic problem and using the default decision (binary)
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
       add_min_set_objective() \%>\%
       add_relative_targets(0.1)

# manually specify a binary decision type
p2 <- p \%>\% add_binary_decisions()

# specify a proportion decision type
p3 <- p \%>\% add_proportion_decisions()

# specify a semicontinuous decision type
p4 <- p \%>\% add_semicontinuous_decisions(upper_limit=0.5)

\donttest{
# solve problem
s <- stack(solve(p), solve(p2), solve(p3), solve(p4))

# plot solutions
plot(s, main = c("default (binary)", "binary", "proportion",
                 "semicontinuous (upper=0.5)"))
}
