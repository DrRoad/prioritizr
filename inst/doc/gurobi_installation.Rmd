## Introduction

_Gurobi_ is the most powerful and fastest solver that _prioritizr_ can use to solve conservation planning problems. This vignette will walk you through the process of setting up _Gurobi_ on your computer so that you can use it to solve conservation planning problems. If you encounter any problems while following the instructions below, check out the [official _Gurobi_ documentation](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/) or the [official _Gurobi_ emailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gurobi).

## Obtaining a license

_Gurobi_ is a commercial computer program. [This means that users will need to obtain a license for _Gurobi_ before they can use it](http://www.gurobi.com/products/licensing-pricing/licensing-overview). Although academics can obtain a special license at no cost, individuals that are not affiliated with a recognized educational institution may need to purchase a license to use _Gurobi_. If you are an academic that is affiliated with an educational institution, you can take advantage of the [special academic license](https://user.gurobi.com/download/licenses/free-academic) to use _Gurobi_ for no cost. Once you have signed up for a free account you can request a [free academic license](https://www.gurobi.com/registration/academic-license-reg).

Once you accept the Terms Of Service you can generate a license.

Now, copy and save the `grbgetkey XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX` command for later use.

## Downloading the _Gurobi_ software suite

After obtaining a license, you will need to download a copy of the _Gurobi_ installer to your computer. To achieve this, visit the [_Gurobi_ downloads web page](http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer) and download the correct version of the installer for your operating system.

## Software installation

The installation process for the _Gurobi_ software suite depends on the type of operating system you have installed on your computer. Fortunately, _Gurobi_ provide platform-specific ["Quick Start Guides"](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/) for [Windows](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/quickstart_windows/software_installation_guid.html#section:Installation), [Mac OSX](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/quickstart_mac/software_installation_guid.html), and [Linux](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/quickstart_linux/software_installation_guid.html) systems that should help with this. Briefly, on Windows systems, you just need to double-click on the _Gurobi_ installer, follow the prompts, and the installer will take care of rest. Whereas, on Linux systems, you will need to manually extract downloaded file's contents to a folder, move the extracted contents to a suitable location (typically _/opt/gurobi_), and update your system's variables so that it knows where to find _Gurobi_. Additionally, if you are using [_RStudio_](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) on a Linux system, you might need to add the following line to the file located at _/etc/rstudio/rserver.conf_:

```
rsession-ld-library-path=/opt/gurobi650/linux64/lib
```

After installing the _Gurobi_ software suite on your computer, you will need to activate your license.

## License activation

Now we will activate the _Gurobi_ software using the license you downloaded earlier. To achieve this, simply copy and paste the `grbgetkey` command into your computer's command prompt or terminal (note that Windows users can open the command prompt by typing `cmd` in the search box and pressing the `enter` key). After running the `grbgetkey` command with the correct license code, you should see output that looks something like that in the screen shot below.

<br><center>![](figures/cmd-windows-success.png){ width=75% }</center><br>

We can double check that the license has been successfully activated by running _Gurobi_ from the command line. Assuming you have installed _Gurobi_ version 7.5.1, Windows users can type in the following the following commands:

```
gurobi_cl c:\gurobi751\win64\examples\data\coins.lp
```

Additionally, Linux users can test their license activation using the following commands

```
gurobi_cl /opt/gurobi751/linux64/examples/data/coins.lp
```

If the license was successfully activated, you should see output that looks something like that in the screen shot below.

<br><center>![](figures/model-test.png){ width=75% }</center><br>

After activating the license, you now need to install the _Gurobi_ _R_ package named _gurobi_.

## _R_ package installation

Now we will install the _gurobi R_ package distributed with the _Gurobi_ software suite. The _gurobi_ _R_ package installation file should be located within the folder where you installed the _Gurobi_ software suite. Assuming you installed _Gurobi_ in the default location and assuming you installed version 7.5.1, Windows users can install _gurobi_ _R_ package by running the following code from within _R_:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("c:/gurobi751/win64/R/gurobi_7.5-1.zip", repos = NULL)
```

Additionally, Linux users can install the _gurobi_ _R_ package by running the following code from within R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(file.path(Sys.getenv("GUROBI_HOME"), "R/gurobi_7.5-1.zip"),
                 repos = NULL)
```

Next, you will need to install the _slam R_ package because the _gurobi_ _R_ package needs this package to work. Both Windows and Linux users can do this by running the code below in _R_:

```{r, eval  = FALSE}
install.packages("slam", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org")
```

Let's check that the _gurobi_ _R_ package has been successfully installed. To do this, we can try using the _gurobi R_ package to solve an optimization problem. Copy and paste the _R_ code below into _R_.

```{r}
# load gurobi package
library(gurobi)

# create optimization problem
model <- list()
model$obj        <- c(1, 1, 2)
model$modelsense <- "max"
model$rhs        <- c(4, 1)
model$sense      <- c("<", ">")
model$vtype      <- "B"
model$A          <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 0), nrow = 2, ncol = 3,
                           byrow = TRUE)

# solve the optimization problem using Gurobi
result <- gurobi(model, list())

# print the solution
print(result$objval) # objective
print(result$x)      # decision variables
```

If you see the outputs for `result$objval` and `result$x` and you don't see any error messages, then you have (1) successfully installed the _Gurobi_ software suite, (2) activated a valid license, and (3) successfully installed the _gurobi R_ package. Now you can finally use _Gurobi_ to solve conservation planning problems with _prioritizr_. If do see an error message, then you might have missed a step while installing the package or activating the license, so try going back through this vignette to see if you missed something.

## Solving a _prioritzr_ problem with _Gurobi_

If you successfully installed the _Gurobi_ software suite and the _gurobi_ _R_ package, you can now try solving conservation planning problems using the _prioritzr_ _R_ package. Although the _prioritizr_ _R_ package should automatically detect that _Gurobi_ has been installed, you can use the function `add_gurobi_solver` to manually specify that _Gurobi_ should be used to solve problems. This function is also useful because you can use it to customize the optimization process (e.g. specify the desired optimality gap or set a limit on how much time should be spent searching for a solution).

Finally, to check that everything has been installed correctly, we will use the _Gurobi_ software suite to solve a reserve selection problem created using the _prioritzr_ _R_ package.

```{r, fig.height = h, fig.width = w}
library(prioritizr)

# formulate the problem
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) %>%
     add_min_set_objective() %>%
     add_relative_targets(0.1) %>%
     add_gurobi_solver()

# solve the problem
s <- solve(p)

# plot solution
plot(s, col = c("grey90", "darkgreen"), main = "Solution",
     xlim = c(-0.1, 1.1), ylim = c(-0.1, 1.1))
```

After running this code, hopefully, you should some information printed on-screen about the optimization process and _R_ should produce a map displaying a solution. If this code does not produce any errors, then you have successfully installed everything and can begin using _Gurobi_ and _prioritizr_ to solve your very own conservation planning problems.
