\description{
\code{Prioritizr} is an R package for solving systematic conservation 
prioritization problems using integer linear programming (ILP) techniques. 
The package offers a flexible interface for creating conservation problems 
using a range of different objectives and constraints that can be tailored 
to the specific needs of the conservation planner. Conservation problems 
can be solved using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm 
solvers. In contrast to the algorithms conventionally used to solve 
conservation problems, such as greedy heuristics or simulated annealing, 
the ILP algorithms used by prioritizr are guaranteed to find optimal 
solutions. This package also has the functionality to read 
\href{http://marxan.net/}{Marxan} input data and find much cheaper 
solutions in a much shorter period of time than Marxan.
 
The supplemental \code{prioritizrdata} package can be downloaded with 
\code{prioritizr} for example datasets and worked examples of 
formulating conservation planning problems. See the 
\href{https://github.com/prioritizr}{github repository} for more details.

The following vignettes are available in prioritizr:

\describe{

  \item{\href{inst/doc/prioritizr.html}{prioritizr vignette}}{provides background information 
on the concepts and terminology of systematic conservation prioritization underlying 
the functions in this package.}

  \item{\href{inst/doc/prioritizr.html}{quickstart vignette}}{provides a walk-through 
of the functions available in the prioritizr package and their usage with a simulated dataset.
Users should be familiar with the basic terminology of systematic conservation priortization.}
