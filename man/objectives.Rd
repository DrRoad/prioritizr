\title{Problem objective}
\usage{
minimum_set_objective()

maximum_coverage_objective(budget)

phylogenetic_coverage_objective(budget, tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of 
the prioritization.}

\item{tree}{\code{\link[ape]{phylo}} object specifying a phylogenetic tree}
}
\description{
The problem objective specifies how the problem \code{\link{targets}} should
be used to generate a solution. All conservation planning problems require
an objective in order to be solved. See below for details on the problem
objectives that are available.
}
\details{
Here is a list of the available objectives and a description
 of each of them.
 \describe{
   \item{minimum_set_objective}{The objective here is to find the 
    the solution that fulfills all the targets and constraints for 
    the smallest cost. This objective is similar to that used in Marxan.}
   \item{maximum_coverage_objective}{The objective here is to find the
    the solution that fulfills as many targets as possible while ensuring
    that the cost of the solution does not exceed budget and that all
    constraints are met. This objective is similar to that used in
    Zonation.}
   \item{phylogenetic_coverage_objective}{This objective is similar to 
    \code{maximum_coverage_objective} except that emphasis is placed
    on preserving as much of a representative sample a phylogenetic
    tree as possible given a budget. This objective requires the
    "ape" R package to be installed.}
 }
}
\examples{
# minimum set objective
problem(sim_pu, sim_features) + minimum_set_objective()

# maximum coverage objective
problem(sim_pu, sim_features) + maximum_coverage_objective(cost=20)

# phylogenetic coverage objective
problem(sim_pu, sim_features) + 
 phylogenetic_coverage_objective(cost=20, tree=sim_phylogeny)
