\title{Add Maximum Coverage Objective}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem-class}} object.}

\item{budget}{\code{numeric} value specifying the maximum expenditure of
the prioritization.}
}
\description{
Set an objective to find the solution that secures as much of each feature as possible
without exceeding the budget.
}
\details{
A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the 
conservation planning problem. All conservation planning problems require an objective in order to
be solved. While some users may feel that explicitly defining an objective
for a conservation problem adds some element of arbitrariness or
subjectivity to the decision making process, we remind them that "canned"
decision support tools (such as Marxan or Zonation) also have objectives. The
key difference here is that instead of choosing between different software
programs here the user is explicitly choosing their objective within the
single environment.

\examples{
# load data
data(sim_pu_raster, sim_features, sim_phylogeny)

# create base problem
p <- problem(sim_pu_raster, sim_features) \%>\%
 add_relative_targets(0.1)

p1 <- p \%>\% add_min_set_objective()
# create problem with added maximum coverage objective
note that this objective does not use targets
p2 <- p \%>\% add_max_cover_objective(5000)

# create problem with added maximum feature representation objective
p3 <- p \%>\% add_max_features_objective(5000)

# create problem with added maximum phylogenetic representation objective
p4 <- p \%>\% add_max_phylo_objective(5000, sim_phylogeny)

\donttest{
# solve problems
s <- stack(solve(p1), solve(p2), solve(p3), solve(p4))

# plot solutions
plot(s, main=c("minimum set", "maximum coverage", "maximum representation",
               "phylogenetic representation"))
