\title{Target weights}
\usage{
target_weights(x, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.}

\item{weights}{\code{numeric} target weights. Higher values for a feature 
indicate that it is more desireable to represent the feature in a network. 
Weights cannot have negative values.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object with the target weights
  added to it.
}
\description{
Targets are used to express the minimum amount or poportion of a 
feature's distribution that is required for it to be adequately conserved
in a protected area network. However, when using a maximum coverage problem 
it may not be possible to preserve all features. Target weights can
be used to favour the representation of some features over other features
when making decisions about how the budget should be allocated.
}
\details{
Target weights can only be applied to a maximum coverage
  type of planning problem (eg. \code{\link{maximum_coverage_objective}},
  \code{\link{phylogenetic_coverage_objective}}).
}
\examples{
# create problem
p <- problem(cost=sim_pu_raster, features=sim_features) \%>\%
  maximum_coverage_objective() \%>\%
  relative_targets(0.1)

# create weights based on rarity (1/number occurrences)
w <- 1/raster::cellStats(sim_features, 'sum') 

# add weight the targets in a problem
p \%>\% target_weights(w)
