\description{
Targets are used to specify the minimum amount or proportion of a feature's 
distribution that needs to be protected. Below is a list of different 
targets that can be added to a conservation planning \code{\link{problem}}.
}
\details{
\describe{
  \item{\code{relative_targets}}{Targets are expressed as a proportion 
    (between 0
    and 1) of the maximum level of representation in the study area.
    The argument to \code{x} should have a single value if all features
    have the same target. Otherwise, the vector should have a value for
    each feature. In this case, targets are assigned to features based
    on the their position in the argument to \code{x} and the
    \code{feature} when specifying the problem.}

\item{\code{absolute_targets}}{Targets are expressed as the actual value 
    that needs to be represented in the prioritisation. The argument to 
    \code{x} is treated the same as for \code{relative_targets}.}

\item{\code{loglinear_targets}}{Targets are expressed as a proportion 
    (between 0
    and 1) which is calculated using a log-linear equation and four
    tuning parameters (as used in XXX \emph{et al.} XXX). The first
    tuning parameter specifies the first cut-off range size,
    and the second the second cut-off range size, the third argument
    specifies the target required for species with a range size equal
    to or less than the first cut-off range size, and the fourth
    argument specifies the target required for species with a range
    size equal to or greater than the required range size.}

\item{\code{default_targets}}{The default targets are used when targets
    have not explicitly been set using the above functions.
    The targets used in to construct conservation planning problem have 
    a profound affect on the solution. Relying on the default targets
    will result in an error because \emph{"Let the computer find out" is 
    a poor strategy and usually reflects the fact that the researcher did 
    not bother to think clearly about the problem of interest and its 
    scientific setting (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).}}

# create basic problem

# add relative targets
p + relative_targets(0.1)

# add absolute targets
p + absolute_targets(3)

# add log-linear target
p + loglinear_targets(c(1, 10, 0.9, 0.2))
