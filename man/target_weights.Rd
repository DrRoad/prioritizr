\title{Target weights}
\usage{
target_weights(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{numeric} target weights. Higher values for a feature indicate
that it is more desireable to represent the feature in a network. Weights
cannot have negative values.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{Constraint}} object containing the weight data.
}
\description{
Targets are used to express the minimum amount or poportion of a 
feature's distribution required to preserve it in a protected area
network. However, when using a maximum coverage problem with a pre-specified
budget, it may not be possible to preserve all features. Target weights can
be used to favour the representation of some features over other features
when making decisions about how the budget should be allocated.
}
\details{
Note that target weights can only be applied to a maximum coverage
  type of planning problem (eg. \code{\link{maximum_coverage_objective}},
  \code{\link{phylogenetic_coverage_objective}}).
}
\examples{
# create problem
p <- problem(cost=sim_pu_raster, features=sim_features) + 
  maximum_coverage_objective() +
  relative_targets(0.1)

# create weights based on rarity (1/number occurrences)
w <- 1/raster::cellStats(sim_features, 'sum') 

# add weight the targets in a problem
p <- p + target_weights(w)
