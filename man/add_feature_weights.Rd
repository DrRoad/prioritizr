\title{Add feature weights}
\usage{
add_feature_weights(x, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object.}

\item{weights}{\code{numeric} weights. Higher values for a feature 
indicate that it is more desireable to represent the feature in a network. 
Weights cannot have negative values.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{ConservationProblem}} object with the weights
  added to it.
}
\description{
Conservation planning problems that aim to maximize the representation of 
features the budget is not high enough. In such budget-limited problems,
it may be desirable to prefer the representation of some features
over other features. Feature weights can be be applied to a conservation
planning problem to favour the representation of some features over other 
other features when making decisions about how the budget should be 
allocated.
}
\details{
Weights can only be applied to a budget-limited 
  type of planning problem (ie. \code{\link{maximum_coverage_objective}},
  \code{\link{maximum_representation_objective}}, and
  \code{\link{phylogenetic_representation_objective}}).
}
\examples{
# create problem
p <- problem(cost=sim_pu_raster, features=sim_features) \%>\%
  maximum_coverage_objective() \%>\%
  relative_targets(0.1)

# create weights based on rarity (1/number occurrences)
w <- 1/raster::cellStats(sim_features, 'sum') 

# add weight the targets in a problem
p \%>\% add_feature_weights(w)
